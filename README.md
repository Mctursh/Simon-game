# Simon-game

# How to play the game: when the game starts and you see a highlighted box you'll click it to move to level 2

Then another box wil be highlighted, now you'll follow the pattern by clicking first the level 1 highlighted box before the level 2 highlighted box.

after successfully clicking the right boxes you'll move to level 3 and another box will be highlighted and you'll simply click in the order the box was highlighted to level 3 an so on


# enjoy the game.
